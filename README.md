### Hello! I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student within the Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Controls at University of California, San Diego. I also did my undergraduate curriculum at UCSD!

My undergraduate focus was within controls, software, machine learning, and robotics, but for my masters, I wish to focus more on SLAM and the intersection of it with computer vision! I believe that perception combined with sensor technologies is the foundation for autonomous environment understanding. Outside of school, I love learning new things and have a passion for becoming better each day. 

Currently, I am part of Triton AI and Triton Droids, where I contribute to software endeavors.
